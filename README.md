## 🌱 Why ZenPose?

Zoom workouts and online yoga are everywhere — but without real-time feedback, small misalignments can lead to long-term injuries.  
We asked: *What if AI could guide your form like a yoga coach?*

---

## 💡 What It Does

ZenPose is a web app that helps users practice yoga safely by:

- 🧍 Detecting your pose using **BlazePose**
- 📈 Showing real-time pose progress with a visual bar
- 📸 Capturing a screenshot when your form is correct
- 💬 Using the **Gemini API** to give instant, personalized feedback

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Pose Detection** – BlazePose tracks body joints  
2. **Pose Evaluation** – Angles compared relative to the hips  
3. **Stability Buffer** – Only scores when you're steady  
4. **AI Feedback** – Gemini analyzes and gives encouragement or corrections  
5. **Gamification** – Earn points and insights as you move

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **BlazePose** – Pose detection  
- **React Native** – Frontend  
- **Gemini API** – Feedback generation  
- **Custom Math** – Relative angle detection & smoothing logic  
- **AI + UX** – Built for clarity and inclusivity

---

## 🧗 Challenges We Faced

- Pose misclassification due to user differences  
- Inaccurate results with fixed position models

**Our solutions:**

- Anchored poses to hip position  
- Used **relative** angles instead of absolute coordinates  
- Added buffer logic to reduce flickering  
- Designed for better **accessibility** and real-world accuracy

---

## 🧠 What We Learned

- None of us had AI experience going in — and that’s the magic of it!  
- AI helped us prototype, debug, and dream faster  
- We even used AI to generate reference pose data  
- Tech should amplify creativity — not replace it

> “AI helped us turn vague ideas into working features — in just 24 hours.”
